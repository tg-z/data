# unix philosophy
## origin 
	The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural
norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is
based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix
developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into
software engineering practice, spawning a "software tools" movement. Over time, the
leading developers of Unix established a set of cultural norms for developing software;
these norms became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has
been termed the "Unix philosophy." 
	The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short,
clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by
developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to
monolithic design. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

It was later summarized by Peter H. Salus in A Quarter-Century of Unix (1994):[1]
1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
2. Write programs to work together.
3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
